# Procedure for Metaplex DAO Treasury Initiative Proposals

TLDR: The Metaplex Foundation will implement the following procedure for community proposals for Metaplex DAO treasury initiatives in support of the Metaplex ecosystem (“DAO Treasury Initiatives”):

1. _Proposals._ Anyone may propose a DAO Treasury Initiative by: (1) completing a DAO Treasury Initiative proposal form; and (2) proving ownership of 5,000 $MPLX (subject to revision by Metaplex Foundation based on the market price of $MPLX). Proposals should provide sufficient details for the community to consider, including a well thought out explanation, budget, timeline and success metrics. 

2. _Community Feedback & Initial Review._ The community will be able to provide feedback on proposed DAO Treasury Initiatives on the Metaplex Foundation Github Repo. The Metaplex Foundation will screen out proposals that are spam, made in bad faith, designed to intentionally harm the DAO, or would violate any applicable laws or regulations.

3. _Voting Period._ Following the community feedback period, the Metaplex Foundation will open the voting period. Voting will be based on $MPLX ownership, meaning that one $MPLX equals one vote. The Metaplex Foundation will specify the minimum number of total votes that must be submitted for the vote to count. Approval requires (a) >50% of votes are “Yes” votes, and (b) total "Yes" votes cast exceeds the specified minimum number of votes.

4. _Implementation._ If approved by the community via a DAO vote, then the DAO Council will execute the DAO treasury transactions according to the approved DAO Treasury Initiative’s specifications. If applicable, the individual or team responsible for managing the approved DAO Treasury Initiative must agree to customary contract terms. 

The Metaplex Foundation may change the procedure for submitting and reviewing DAO Treasury Initiative proposals based on experience and community feedback.

Note: DAO Treasury Initiatives do not include community grants. If you are interested in a grant from the DAO for your team or project, submit a grant proposal instead: https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/dao/blob/main/mplx-grants.md

# Full Procedure for Proposals for Metaplex DAO Treasury Initiatives 

This procedure applies to community proposals for Metaplex DAO treasury initiatives in support of the Metaplex ecosystem (“DAO Treasury Initiatives”). The Metaplex DAO controls a treasury of $MPLX tokens and other assets that the DAO can use to provide for the long-term sustainability and growth of the Metaplex ecosystem. The Metaplex ecosystem includes the Metaplex Program Library (“MPL”), developers and dApp users who interact with the MPL and Metaplex digital assets, and  $MPLX holders. 

The Metaplex DAO treasury balance can be found here: https://dao.metaplex.com

The Metaplex Foundation’s goal with this procedure is to provide a workable framework for community governance of the Metaplex DAO treasury. We expect to learn as we go and to make adjustments based on both our observations and community feedback.

As seen from other web3 ecosystems, examples of DAO Treasury Initiatives might include:
- liquidity incentives for $MPLX
- allocations for validator staking 
- support for governance infrastructure and administration
- campaigns for community education and engagement

In the event that a proposal is in direct opposition to an already approved proposal or identical to a previously unsuccessful proposal, it is not permitted to proceed to voting until at least six months past the implementation of the original proposal. This measure is in place to preserve Metaplex community resources. The Metaplex Foundation may submit proposals for consideration by the DAO that are not bound by this limitation in the event of an emergency, as determined in good faith by the Metaplex Foundation.

## Proposals

Any $MPLX holder (the “Original Proposer”) may propose a DAO Treasury Initiative to the Metaplex repository (currently Github, located here: (https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/mip/) (the “Repo”) by visiting the Metaplex governance website (https://mip.metaplex.com) and (1) completing a DAO Treasury Initiative proposal form; and (2) proving ownership of 5,000 $MPLX (subject to revision by Metaplex Foundation based on the market price of MPLX).

By submitting a proposal form, you consent to the information you include being shared with the community for purposes of considering the proposal. You further acknowledge agreement to our privacy policy (https://dao.metaplex.com/privacy). 

The DAO Treasury Initiative proposal form will require the following information to be completed fully and accurately:

### Title

A concise title describing the initiative. This title will appear as the header of your proposal’s detail page and the community feedback thread generated for your proposal.

### Abstract

Short explanation of the initiative. One or two paragraphs.

### Budget 

Include the amounts requested from the DAO treasury. Be sure to check the assets available in the treasury and consider the amounts necessary for the initiative.

### Timeline

### Motivation

How will it benefit the Metaplex ecosystem? 
Why should we do this? 
What problems does it solve?
What is the expected outcome?

### Drawbacks

What problems could occur if we do this?
What tradeoffs does the proposal necessitate?

### Manager / Managing Team Description


Who will be responsible for managing the initiative? 
If there’s a team behind this proposal, list who they are, how they can be contacted, and their relevant experience.
Does the proposal call for the creation of a working group to oversee the initiative? 

### Detailed Description 

Elaborate on the details for the initiative. 
Introduce and explain concepts. 
Provide representative examples that show how this proposal will work. 
Explain why the budget requested is appropriate. 
Explain the process for implementing the proposal. 

### Success Metrics

## Community Feedback & Initial Review

Each DAO Treasury Initiative proposal will trigger a 7 day “Community Feedback Period”, during which anyone may comment on the proposal in the Repo. This will provide time for the community to voice its opinion on each proposal before a DAO vote is held. 


During the Community Feedback Period, the Metaplex Foundation will review the proposals to screen out ones that are spam, made in bad faith, intentionally damaging to the DAO, or would violate any applicable laws or regulations.


The Metaplex Foundation’s goal is to complete an initial screening decision for each proposal within 3 days of publication on the Repo. If we are unable to meet that goal for any particular proposal, we will publish an update on the Repo with a new target date for our decision. If the Metaplex Foundation screens out a proposal it will post the rationale for doing so on the Repo. Proposals that are screened out will be removed from consideration.


The Original Proposer may propose changes to the proposal or withdraw the proposal at any time prior to the end of the Community Feedback Period.

## Voting Period

At the end of the 7-day Community Feedback Period, the Metaplex Foundation will finalize language for the proposed DAO Treasury Initiative based on the community feedback. 


Voting on materially similar proposals will be sequenced so that only one proposal is voted on by the DAO at a time. The Metaplex Foundation will use its discretion to sequence votes to avoid confusion and potentially conflicting results. Proposals submitted first will be voted on first. 


The “Voting Period” for a proposal will be open for 14 days, unless the proposal is subject to sequencing, in which case it will be open 7 days for later submitted proposals. 

When the Metaplex Foundation opens the Voting Period, it will specify the minimum number of total votes that must be submitted for the vote to count (the “Voting Threshold”). Voting will be based on MPLX ownership, meaning that one MPLX equals one vote. The Metaplex Foundation will announce via Twitter (@MetaplexFndn) and on the Metaplex Discord channel when a Voting Period is beginning and direct the community to where it can cast votes on the Metaplex DAO. The voting mechanics may change in the future as we learn from experience.


The proposed DAO Treasury Initiative will pass if (a) >50% of votes are “Yes” votes, and (b) total "Yes" votes cast exceed the Voting Threshold. If either condition is not met, the proposal will fail.


## Implementation


After the DAO Treasury Initiative has been approved by the DAO, if applicable, the individual or team responsible for managing the DAO Treasury Initiative on behalf of the DAO will need to agree to customary contract terms reflecting the obligations to be carried out prior to any allocation of treasury assets.  


**Disclaimer.** The Metaplex Foundation may terminate a proposal for a DAO Treasury Initiative at any point in the process if it comes into conflict with applicable laws or regulations.
